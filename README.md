MATLAB toolbox to process EcoTaxa data
# run Ecotaxa_tool (F. Lombard 2019 lombard@obs-vlfr.fr)
ecotaxa tool helps you to process raw results originating from quantitative imaging devices and originating from Ecotaxa (https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/) 

ecotaxa tool includes the initial process of raw *.tsv files available from the export function in ecotaxa (Warning, please use the option "one file/sample")

In the future ecotaxa tool will also includes several functions allowing he raw visialisation and raw analysis of your data. Those analysis are only of indicational value and don't dispense to further analyse some more specific features by building/refining the analysis yourself

Zooscan analysis is supporting several scans per samples (and assembling them accordingly to the fractionation)

the resulting structured base includes the following variables as final results
#     Ab  abundance per groups (ind.m-3)
#     Bv biovolume per groups (mm3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Plain_Area_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Riddled_Area_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Ellipsoid_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#    X  is the Middle of each biovolume size class (caution it is in log here) (log(mm3)
#     X1 is the amplitude of each biovolume size class - used for de-normalizing NBSS (mm3)
#     ESD vector is the conversion of X in ESD (Âµm this time)
#     ESDquartilesmoyenne are the 5 25 50 75 95 % quartiles of ESD (+ mean and std) of each groups
