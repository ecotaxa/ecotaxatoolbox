MATLAB toolbox to process EcoTaxa data
# run Ecotaxa_tool (F. Lombard 2019 lombard@obs-vlfr.fr)
ecotaxa tool helps you to process raw results originating from quantitative imaging devices and originating from Ecotaxa (https://ecotaxa.obs-vlfr.fr/) 

ecotaxa tool includes the initial process of raw *.tsv files available from the export function in ecotaxa (Warning, please use the option "one file/sample")
It currently includes
-Flowcytometry (Accuri from Tara, needs adaptation for others)
-eHFCM (from Tara, needs adaptation for others)
-IFCB (from Tara, may need some refinement to process more recent ones)
-Flowcam (1 sample per station of sample separated in small and large fractions)
-Zooscan (several scans per stations, fractions are summed (caution needs to be adapted following the scanning protocol))
-UVP (mix between particles (ecotaxa particule module) and images tsv processing, produce integrated numbers/biovolume/spectras over a given water column)

In the future ecotaxa tool will also includes several functions allowing he raw visialisation (see exotaxa_inspect5.mld) and raw analysis of your data . Those analysis are only of indicational value and don't dispense to further analyse some more specific features by building/refining the analysis yourself

Zooscan analysis is supporting several scans per samples (and assembling them accordingly to the fractionation)

the resulting structured base includes the following variables as final results
#     Ab  abundance per groups (ind.m-3)
#     Bv biovolume per groups (mm3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Plain_Area_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Riddled_Area_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#     Ybv_Ellipsoid_BV_spectra NBSSbiovolume per groups per size class (mm3.mm-3.m-3)
#    X  is the Middle of each biovolume size class (caution it is in log here) (log(mm3)
#     X1 is the amplitude of each biovolume size class - used for de-normalizing NBSS (mm3)
#     ESD vector is the conversion of X in ESD (Âµm this time)
#     ESDquartilesmoyenne are the 5 25 50 75 95 % quartiles of ESD (+ mean and std) of each groups
